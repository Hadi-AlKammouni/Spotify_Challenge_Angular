Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the app uses:

- This project uses the [Angular framework](https://angular.io/guide/what-is-angular). Angular is a development platform, built on Typescript. As a platform, Angular includes: A component-based framework for building scalable web applications / A collection of well-integrated libraries that cover a wide variety of features, including routing, forms management, client-server communication, and more / A suite of developer tools to help you develop, build, test, and update your code.
- The authorization and fetching required data was provided by the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) services.
